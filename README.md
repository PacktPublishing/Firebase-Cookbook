# Firebase Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Firebase Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/firebase-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788296335), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Do you feel tired just thinking or even hearing about backend technologies, authentication or the tedious task of deployment? Firebase is here to change the way you develop and make your app a first-class citizen of the cloud.

This books takes a solution based approach by providing you recipes that would help you understand the features of Firebase and implement them in your existing web or mobile applications.

We start-off by creating our first Firebase application and integrating its services into different platforms and environments for mobile as well as web applications. Then we deep dive into Real-time Database and Firebase Storage that allows your users to access data across various devices with realtive ease. With each chapter you will gradually create the building blocks of your application from securing your data with Firebase Rules to authenticating your users with O-Auth.

Moving along we would explore modern application development techniques such as creating serverless applications with Firebase Cloud Functions or turning your traditional applications into progressive apps with Service workers.

Finally you will learn how to create cross-platform mobile apps, integrate Firebase in native platforms, and learn how to monetize your mobile applications using Admob for Android and iOS.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
//Getting the file reference.
var rootRef = firebase.storage().ref();
var imageRef = rootRef.child('images/<image-name>.<image-ext>');
```

The content requirements are fairly easy for the first 10 chapters; no matter what your operating system or your code editor is, you're always covered.
However, in Chapter 11, Integrating Firebase with Android/iOS Natively, we'll start developing for mobile, so while you will be perfectly fine with any operating system (macOs, Linux, or Windows) when developing for Android, we will definitely need a macOS-based computer in order to follow along with iOS-based recipes.
